Introduction to Computer Graphics Programming

This project focuses on computer graphics programming, specifically designed to run on macOS. To run the mandatory part of the project, simply type 'make,' and for the bonus part, type 'make bonus.'

In the bonus part, I have incorporated additional features, including translate, rotate, and zoom-in/zoom-out capabilities. Running the bonus part enhances the overall user experience, allowing for more interactive and dynamic graphics.

Get ready to explore the fascinating world of computer graphics with this project, and enjoy the added functionalities that the bonus part brings to the table!
